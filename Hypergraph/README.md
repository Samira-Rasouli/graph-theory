**Random Hypergraph Generator in Python**


This Python script generates and visualizes random hypergraphs using a **bipartite graph** model. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph where edges (called hyperedges) can connect any number of nodes.

**In this implementation:**

Each hyperedge is represented as a unique node in a bipartite graph.
The script uses the networkx library to model and visualize the hypergraph.
Nodes, hyperedges, and their connections are generated randomly in each execution.
**Features
Random Hypergraph Generation:**
The number of main nodes (num_nodes) and hyperedges (num_hyperedges) is randomly determined.
Each hyperedge randomly connects to a subset of the main nodes.
**Traversal:**
Depth-First Search **(DFS)** and Breadth-First Search **(BFS)** traversals are implemented to navigate the hypergraph starting from a specific node.
Visualization:
The script visualizes the hypergraph using matplotlib, with distinct colors for main nodes and hyperedges for better clarity.

**Example Execution**
Here is an example of a hypergraph generated by the script:

Number of Nodes: 8

Number of Hyperedges: 3

Each hyperedge connects to a random subset of the nodes. Below is the visualization of the generated hypergraph:


**In the graph:**

Blue nodes represent the main nodes.
Orange nodes represent the hyperedges.
